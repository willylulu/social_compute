    Host can decide whether show the mirror or not,
    if he/she close the mirror, then the chat, price box will 
    filled the screen with a bigger font size. Therefore they can 
    stand at a far distance to stream their product.

    Auto greed from host when customer first enter chatroom.

    Animation alert with 
    1. Customer enter room. (Host)
    2. Customer bought product. (Host)
